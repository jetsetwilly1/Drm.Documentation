# Benefits of using DRM templates

Here are some of the advantages of using DRM templates to manage the 
configuration of your Dynamics environments using automation.

- Get consistency across Dynamics environments, configuration can be 
deployed every time a solutions are updated.
- Storing templates in a repo enables you to track changes to configuration.
- Empower Dynamics developers to generate template configuration during
project sprints.
- Slowly building up a repository of configuration will help reduce effort
in introducing new environments to a running project.

Without automation, deploying Dynamics solutions and configuration could 
quickly become a time consuming process.

Automation of Dynamics solutions solves one part of the problem. Using DRM 
goes towards solving the other issue of configuration.

Simple things can easily be achieved, for example

- Configure teams, associate security roles and even add members.
- Configure queues and add members.
- Manage environment variable value differences across all your instances.
- Configure custom entities, populate project specific tables that are required
for your project.
- Manage connection references for cloudflow integrations.
