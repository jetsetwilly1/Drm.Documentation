# What is DRM Toolbox?

DRM toolbox is a play on XRM Toolbox.  The idea is to build a collection of powershell cmdlets with a focus on 
automation of Dynamics environments.

The cmdlets will be added to the Drm.Templates powershell module making all of the automation tools accessible 
from one place.

## Contribute to the module

The DRM Powershell module is available from github meaning everybody can contribute.

If you think you have a cmdlet that somebody else might find useful then follow
the guidelines on the [github repo](https://github.com/jetsetwilly1/Drm.Powershell)
 to get it included in the module!
